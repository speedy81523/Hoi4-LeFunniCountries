 liberia.1.t:0 "What A Fucking Shit Governent"
 liberia.1.d:0 "Liberia, that is our homeland. It the homeland of many people, from American-Liberians to Native Africans. It was founded on the principles  of democracy and equality. Yet, look at Liberia now, a shitty ass nation. The government can't even bring the nation back from the Great Depression. Hell, even the Firestone Rubber, a company that deals in rubber, would be better to lead the nation better than Barclay and his buffoons. We can also get the natives to overthrow the government, i mean its their land right? I hate this government. It is time to throw the Government into the bin and remake Liberia into a brand new state."

 news.600.t:0 "Coup In Liberia"
 news.600.d:0 "In a stunning move, the government of Liberia has been overthrown by the Firestone Rubber Company. In a statement, the company said that it had "long been concerned about the direction of the country" and that it had "decided to take matters into its own hands. The company has promised to 'run the country in a more efficient and effective manner' and has vowed to 'make Liberia great again.' The move has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising Firestone for its 'bold' move and others condemning it as a 'corporate takeover.' What is clear is that Liberia will never be the same again."
